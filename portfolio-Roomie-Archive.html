				<h3>1. The Emerging Needs of Home Renting and Roommates Searching.</h3>

				<p>A friend recently relocate to the bay area and she had a quite a long journey looking for new roommates. It's very common as more and more people swarm into cities and rent homes. But the experience was not always nice. So I challenged myself to design a better experience for my peers to look for new rooms and roommates.</p>
        <div id="rentData">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-6">

				<p>I conducted 5 in-depth semi-structured interviews to understand participants’ past experience looking for a roommate and room.

					<h3>2. Analysing Competitor Services</h3>
					<p>After understanding user’s needs and pain points. I researched what competitors are providing, what I can learn from them and what could be done better.</p>

					</div>
					<p class="small"> Competitive analysis amongst 4 service providers</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Craigslist</span> has a rich source of room information, it’s useful when someone needs a room urgently. But it doesn’t have identity verification so it’s hard to tell the truthfulness of the information. I found users on craigslist often ask potential renters to provide Facebook account or LinkedIn account for identity verification. As it’s not a dedicated website for room and roommate information, users need to make some effort to find the right information.
					</p>
					<p><span class="bold">Diggz</span> has detailed room information and roommate metric. Users can also ask their Facebook friends to write a reference for them. These efforts make the website more trustworthy than Craigslist, while the safety issue is not stressed enough.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Roomi</span> is an iOS app with informative listings and offers background checks for room renters. However, it’s more like a room finder because you can find less information about the future roommates on it.

					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">RentHoop</span> is another iOS app with a focus on roommates. Users can set detailed roommate preference and 3 deal breakers. It’s like the tinder for roommates. The room information purely relied on users themselves, and is not that detailed. Also, the safety issue is not addressed.

					<h3>Design Goal</h3>

					<p class="small">Design Goals</p>







					<h3>3. The Signup Flow - 2 decisions, 4 design options, and 5 testings</h3>
					<p>The 4 design options for the onboarding and sign up flow are results of the combination of 2 design decisions: </p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
							<img class="img-responsive" alt="decision: when to sign up" src="img/img-Roomie_decision-1.svg">
							<p class="small">Design decision 1: Sign up first V.S. Sign up only when user need message a potential roommate; </P>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-5">
								<img class="img-responsive" alt="decision: when to sign up" src="img/img-Roomie_decision-2.svg">
								<p class="small">Design decision 2: User input first for more accurate results V.S. No input and show general results first;</P>
								</div>
							</div>


							<img class='img-responsive' alt='sign up flow option 1' src='img/img-Roomie_SUF-1.svg'>
							<p class="small">Option 1: User registration and preference input first.</p>
							<p>Assuming that looking for a roommate and a room is an urgent need for the user, and safety is the first priority, asking for user registration and preference before showing the results is reasonable.</p>




							<img class='img-responsive' alt='sign up flow option 2' src='img/img-Roomie_SUF-2.svg'>
							<p class="small">Option 2: User preference first. Registration only needed for further interaction.</p>
							<p>Considering that user might be scared away with so many forms to fill, the second option would be only asking necessary questions to generate a customized results list. Registration is only required when a user finds an ideal roommate and room and take further actions. At this point, if a user sees something useful, he/she will have more motivation to sign up. The experience will be better. </p>





							<img class='img-responsive' alt='sign up flow option 3' src='img/img-Roomie_SUF-3.svg'>
							<p class="small">Option 3: Registration first, no customized results until user later filled out the preferences</p>
							<p>If the reason user don’t like registration is simply don’t want so many actions before seeing the results, I assume postponed the preference input will have a similar effect with the postponed signup form. However, not seeing relevant results after registration might not be a good experience. </p>



							<img class='img-responsive' alt='sign up flow option 4' src='img/img-Roomie_SUF-4.svg'>
							<p class="small">Option 4: results first, customized preference, registration</p>
							<p>One step further: user don’t have to input anything before seeing the general results, and he/she can set the preference to get a more suitable result. When he/she needs to contact the potential roommates, he/she are required to signup then. </p>




							<p>
								To decide which flow to choose, I did 5 quick user testings, going through the flow with 5 users and then ask them about their preferences.
							</p>



							<p>
								<span class="bold">Results:</span> 3 participants preferred telling the app some preferences beforehand if the results listing is more relevant; 1 participant said he has no strong opinion if he is in urgent need for a room and roommate; 1 participant has an equal preference between option 2 and 4.

							</p>





							<h3>4. Paper Prototyping the Detailed flow, Structure, and Functions</h3>
							<p>As soon as the sign up flow is decided, I started sketch quickly on paper of the flow and the structure.  </p>
							<p><span class="bold">Iteration 1:</span> In the first version, users are asked to fill out all the room and roommate preference at once. And in a second version, user enter room preference one at a time, like making a conversation with the App. Step by step is chosen because asking one question at a time is simpler on mobile for users when the questions are not too long.</p>
              <div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
							<img class='img-responsive' alt='Iteration 1: all at once' src='img/img-Roomie_wireframeV1-1.png'></div></div>
							<p class="small"> Flow iteration 1.1 - user fill all the preferences within 2 steps </p>
							<img class='img-responsive' alt='Iteration 1: step by step' src='img/img-Roomie_wireframeV1-2.png'>
							<p class="small"> Flow iteration 1.2 - user fill all the room and roommates preferences step by step </p>


							<p><span class="bold">Iteration 2:</span> I went through the paper prototype and improved its structure by putting the "map view" and the "favorite tap" within the results, and adding a roommate section. Once users become roommates and signed contract, they can use this function to support their most frequent interactions: spare bills.</p>
							<div class="row">
							<div class="col-sm-10 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
							<img class='img-responsive' alt='Iteration 2: structure 1' src='img/img-Roomie_wireframeV2-1.png'></div></div>
							<p class="small"> Structure iteration 2.1 - Result List | Map | Favorite | Messages | Settings  </p>

							<p class="small"> Map the structure with user journey - Result List (Map view, favorites) | Messages | Roommates | Settings </p>




							<h3>5.Validating the Onboarding Flow and Functions on Wireframe</h3>
							<p>Through the 2 iterations of paper prototyping and feedback gathering, the basic logic, the sign up flow and main structures of the App were established. I found it's time to move on to start building wireframes and interactive prototypes to have a more concrete realization of the ideas</p>

							<p>The prototype illustrates the flows and what users can do before and after user sign up. To provide a great user experience, users have the opportunity to search and find what they want even before signing up. This in return provides motivations for users to sign up. It also maps the steps in user journey, addressed the safety issues by user ID and security verification after user sign up. The common pains found in roommates interaction are addressed by providing a private space for split bills and opinion sharing</p>
							<img class='img-responsive' alt='wireframes: before user sign up' src='img/img-Roomie_wireframelines-1.svg'>
							<p class="small"> Before signing up, users can set preferences to search for their next room and roommates, and the preference will be saved <a href="img/img-Roomie_wireframelines-1.svg" target="_blank">Check the full-size image</a> </p>
							<img class='img-responsive' alt='wireframes: after user sign up' src='img/img-Roomie_wireframelines-2.svg'>
							<p class="small"> After user signs up, user can message the potential roommate. Once they become real roommate, they can use the functions in roommates section <a href="img/img-Roomie_wireframelines-2.svg" target="_blank">Check the full-size image</a></p>
							<p>
								Then I build an interactive prototype using Sketch's latest prototype tool. All the effort was to make sure that users will get a holistic idea of the flow experience and key functions provided by the App.
							</p>

							<div class="row" id="prototypeContainer" >
								<div class="col-md-4"></div>
								<div class="col-md-4">
									<img class="img-responsive" alt="prototype gif" id="prototype" src="img/img-Roomie_interactionPrototype.gif">
									<p class="small">Interactive prototype for testing</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-md-4"></div>


							</div>

							<p>With the prototype I conducted 5 user testings with the participants I interviewed earlier. They were asked to look for an ideal room and roommate "Amy", ask her questions and then became roommates. The purpose was to test the flows and the functions within the structure. The users helped me find 2 key insights: </p>

							<p><span class="bold">
								1. "Roommates" section is confusing.</span>
							</p>
							<p style="color: red; font: italic">•"Does it mean I can invite roommate here so our joint preference will be the new preference of the searching list?" </p>
							<p style="color: red; font: italic"> •"Is 'Roommate' section where I invite other people to use this app?"</p>

							<p><span class="bold">
								2. Money transaction function in roommate section is useful while "set up a poll" function is not.</span>
							</p>

							<p>The confusion in "Roommates" section may be caused by three reasons:</p>
							<p> • The name "roommates" can't explain itself well;</p>
							<p> • The action button "Invite a roommate" is misleading;</p>
							<p> • "Roommates" section is intended to be used after users have met, and signed the contract offline and become real roommates, there is a gap of the offline experience in the App.</p>

						<p>Therefore, I plan to make the following changes before moving to hi-fi prototypes:</p>
						<p>• Change "Roommates" section into "Room Hub", metaphorically indicating it's a place of interactions for members who share a room. Easy to understand illustrations were added to deliver the message.</p>
						<p>• Replace "Invite a roommate" with "Add a roommate"</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-3">

								<img class="img-responsive" alt="roommate section before" src="img/img-Roomie_wireframeBefore.png">
								<p class="small"> Before: "invite a roommate" </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-3">

								<img class="img-responsive" alt="roommate section after" src="img/img-Roomie_wireframeAfter.png">
								<p class="small"> After: "Add a roommate" </p>
							</div>


							<div class="col-md-3">

								<img class="img-responsive" alt="activities before" src="img/img-Roomie_wireframeBefore2.png">
								<p class="small"> Before: Payment and Poll </p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-3">

								<img class="img-responsive" alt="activities after" src="img/img-Roomie_wireframeAfter2.png">
								<p class="small"> After: Payment only </p>
							</div>

						</div>




						<h3>6. Visuals, Styles and Further Improvements</h3>
						<h3>Exploring Styles via Moodboards</h3>
						<p>As the flows and functions were refined through wireframe and testing, I started making mood boards to pick the visuals and styles of the App. I explored 4 different color themes that bring different feels.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6">

								<img class='img-responsive' alt='style 1' src='img/img-Roomie_mood-1.png'>
								<p class="small">1. Warmth, home, friendly, calm</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">

								<img class='img-responsive' alt='style 2' src='img/img-Roomie_mood-2.png'>
								<p class="small">2. Easy-going, fun, happy, breeze</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">

								<img class='img-responsive' alt='style 3' src='img/img-Roomie_mood-3.png'>
								<p class="small">3. Neutral, calm, easy-going</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">

								<img class='img-responsive' alt='style 4' src='img/img-Roomie_mood-4.png'>
								<p class="small">4. Efficient, professional, friendly, calm, trustworthy</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Style 4 was chosen for it's professional, slick and simple design feel. It's neutral yet let people trust it to get the job done.</p>

						<h3>Icons, illustrations, and atomic design</h3>
						<p>As the main tone was set for this App, I started designing the icons, illustrations that are consistent with the established feel</p>
						<div class="row">

							<img class='img-responsive' alt='style 1' src='img/img-Roomie_evalutionIcon.svg'>

						</div>

						<div class="row">

							<img class="img-responsive" alt="interfaces" src="img/img-Roomie_illustrations.png">
							<p class="small">Illustrations</p>
						</div>
						<p>With the colors, illustrations style set, I designed the units in each interface so that they will be consistently reused across the app.</p>

						<h3>Summaries and Next Steps</h3>
						<p>This is a personal project triggered by seeing some of my friends suffering from finding roommates and room. And I challenged myself to practice lean UX within a limited time range (two weeks) with a user-centered approach. As a person who always does a ton of research for validation before start designing, it's fun to push myself on purpose to craft and design with limited user research information. The hardest part was to make the most logical and valid design decisions with limited user input.</p>
						<p>
							For next steps, I will first test the high-fidelity prototype with more potential users to improve its overall usability. From the previous user research, I learned that the most frequent activity among roommates is money transfer. Digging deeper, I want to figure out if there is any other activities or services that can foster a good roommate relationship, and can be added to the App. Lastly, seeing the whole user journey, the experience of roommates meet in person and sign the contract was not part of the App. That causes confusion. My current solution focused on using illustrations and wordings to make the flow clear to the users. Thinking out of the box, is there any possibilities to incorporate this offline experience into the App to make a seamless experience?
