				<h1>NewA Technology  <span class="thin"> - Creating a lively experience for the enterprise product launch.</span></h1>
				<p>Context: NewA Technology(Now R2.ai) was going to launch Mr.One Alpha, our first web application that handles AI-powered predictive modeling and data analysis for both experts and none-experts. I was tasked to design the company's website. It's our first attempt to introduce our product to the potential users. The website also helps establish an online identity of the company to deliver the message to the right audiences. </p>

				<h3>1. Creating a sustainable structure </h3>

				<p>
					By collaborating closely with the CEO, we firstly discussed "what" will be shown on the website. Back then, Mr.One was ready to accept alpha testers and the other product, "NewApedia" was under construction. And I was told that we were also in the process of planning other data analysis services. The website should inform the audiences what the company is about, and all the products and services it provides. Taken all that is happening into consideration, I suggested a structure that can accommodate the available contents we can show on the launching day. It became an extendable basis. As the company grows fast and new needs emerge, new contents can be added along the way seamlessly.</p>

			<h3>2. Exploring a narrative to deliver the message accurately </h3>
			<p>
				Machine learning and AI-powered data modeling often sound complicated and unapproachable. As NewA Tech's goal was to democratize the AI-powered modeling process, Our website serves as a bridge to connect our potential customers (Mainly non-expert users, e.g., business executives and business analysts) with our product. Through the website, we want to deliver the message that with Mr.One, people with little data science background can do complex data modeling too. Therefore, it needs a lively style and natural narrative to deliver that message to our audience.

			<p class='small'>Figure 3-1,2,3. Exploring narratives: Scenarios, Compelling questions, Elevator pitch</p>
			<p>In collaboration with the CEO, I tried using scenarios to tell the story, asking compelling questions as well as delivering the message just through a simple elevator pitch. The scenarios might be too specific, users might not be able to relate it to their own problems. And the simple elevator pitch is a bit abstract to understand for people without data science background. Therefore, we chose the second option as a narrative. Also, the CEO wanted the website feels young and updated with the current design trends, light colors were chosen to bring a less boring feel.</p>

			<h3>3. Adding a hint of personality and keeping the style consistent</h3>

			<p>
				As the style was defined, I also made sure it was consistent across other sub-pages. Though Mr.One is an enterprise product, viewing the launch of it can also be an engaging experience. The details were also applied when introducing the makers behind it.</p>

				<p>Working with the CTO John and front-end developers, we implemented it in March 2017. After the launch, we also tested it and made constant improvements. The site helped attract alpha testers as well as investors. But it's currently not in use as the company is undergoing a renaming and rebranding.
